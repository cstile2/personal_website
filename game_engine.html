        This passion project is a fully featured game engine framework designed to be immediately useful without sacrificing low-level power. It emphasizes utility, scalability, and adaptability, with minimal dependencies (more details here).
      </div>
      <div class = "body_text">Here is a list of features that I implemented from scratch:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          GLTF (JSON) parser + importer
          <ul>
            <li>
              Takes in 3D asset files and imports them into your game application with a single function call!
            </li>
            <li>
              Creates a parse tree representation of the file, which is used to reconstruct the data in-engine.
            </li>
            <li>
              Supports 3D meshes, animations, textures, and materials.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Animation System
          <ul>
            <li>
              Full support for 3D animations.
            </li>
            <li>
              Animation blending and transitions work efficiently.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Data-Oriented Entity Component System
          <ul>
            <li>
              A dynamic system that replaces inheritance by using collections of components. Anything can become anything else in your game.
            </li>
            <li>
              Component data is stored in contiguous arrays, saving storage over traditional plain structs with fields.
            </li>
            <li>
              The "Archetype" technique is used to optimize for entity iteration speed, which is huge for having lots of game objects!
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Physically Based Render (PBR)
          <ul>
            <li>
              Uses industry-standard PBR (physically based rendering) techniques to create realistic visuals.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Collision System
          <ul>
            <li>
              Ray-casts, time-of-impact calculation, GJK-based collision detection and solver.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Octree-based spatial acceleration structure to narrow only to potential collisions.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Collision functions come in general-use variants and single-use variants.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Multithreaded Parallelism
          <ul>
            <li>
              Worker threads are used to process entities in parallel.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The audio engine uses a dedicated thread without using mutex locks.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
